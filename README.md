Why?
CD/DVD drivers are becoming less and less common. 
I've tried installing operating systems from USB drives with varing levels of success.
Most of the time the USB drives are just too slow, especially in old PCs, some won't even give a USB devices as a boot option.
So many PCs have network boot ROMs built into the box
Pendrives can easily be misplaced.
Your going to be pluggin a network cable in most cases, why not boot using it too?

Goals
Add EFI support
Persistant storage
WinPE
Web interface to manage boot menu/options


Issues
Rasbian only comes with syslinux 4.05
